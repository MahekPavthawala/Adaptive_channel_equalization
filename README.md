# Adaptive_channel_equalization
Using LMS algorithm, the channel is equalized with MATLAB and outputs are observed as the channel equalization is the traversal filter with the type of FIR linear filter.

## About
The LMS algorithm has been very often used to adapt the coefficients of a transversal filter, because it is simple and has robustness to numerical calculations. One of the application areas where the LMS adaptive filter is favourably used is that of channel equalization in digital communication systems. However, modem development of multipoint telephone network systems requires fast convergence, so-called fast start-up equalization, of the LMS adaptive filter. For this reason, many adaptive algorithms have been addressed in the last three decades. Most of them, however, sacrifice the computational complexity for updating the filter coefficients. Adaptive equalizers are necessary for reliable communication of digital data across non-ideal channels.

## Requirements:

MUST need MATLAB 2015a or greater version with DSP-Communication Toolbox and Visualization Toolbox
Also, one can use the online MATLAB available.

**Note=** To use MATLAB, one might have to use institutional login or might have to work with free trial.

I advise to use the book of the Monson H. Hayes for the reference with the codes and the explaination. See <a href= 'https://bcs.wiley.com/he-bcs/Books?action=index&itemId=0471594318&bcsId=3698'> Statistical Digital Signal Processing and Modeling </a> for the more information.
